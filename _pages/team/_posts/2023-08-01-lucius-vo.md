I'm Huynh Quang Nguyen Vo, known as Lucius. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering and Management at Oklahoma State University (OSU) in Stillwater.

Before joining OSU, I worked at Intel Products Vietnam, an assembly/test manufacturing site for Intel Corp. My role involved developing and deploying automated inspection solutions for downstream processes and mentoring aspiring engineers in programming and machine learning (ML) methods as an associate of both Intel AI and Intel Image Analytics Centers of Excellence. Prior to Intel, I was an engineering trainee at First Solar Vietnam, where I contributed to a project on commonality analysis for defects generated by laser scribing processes on thin-film solar panels. Additionally, I collaborated with Dr. Petri Kärhä and Prof. Erkki Ikonen at Aalto University on developing a measurement setup to determine the differential spectral responsivity of solar cells.

I am proficient in Python, statistical analysis with SAS JMP, data retrieval and processing with SQL, and data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn. I also excel in digital image processing with OpenCV, and ML/DL model development and deployment with scikit-learn and TensorFlow. These skills are demonstrated through my Data Science projects and guest lectures at various universities. Besides, I am passionate about writing as well. 

You can find many of my posts on my website, where I share experiences on learning English, showcase my data science portfolio, and provide commentaries on social issues.
