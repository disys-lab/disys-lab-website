I am a Ph.D. student in Industrial Engineering and Management at Oklahoma State University, where I focus on developing and integrating machine learning models and large-scale optimization techniques to solve complex industrial challenges. I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science from Texas A&M University Kingsville, where my thesis focused on detecting deepfakes using convolutional neural networks. I also earned a B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering from American International University-Bangladesh.

My research interests encompass machine learning, cybersecurity, theoretical computer science, and decentralized systems like blockchain. I have contributed to various research projects, including developing a multi-channel blockchain for distributed energy resources and a modular blockchain framework for solar farms, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.

Before pursuing my higher studies, I worked as a software engineer at Era-InfoTech Limited in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where I developed cloud-based solutions using Azure, Node JS, React JS, MongoDB, and CosmosDB. My technical skills span multiple programming languages and platforms, including Java, C++, Python, and SQL, as well as web development technologies.

I have been honored with several awards, including the 2024 Energy Systems Division Best Student Paper runner-up award and a Graduate Merit Scholarship from Texas A&M University Kingsville. I have also been invited to speak at renowned conferences such as the 2024 INFORMS Annual Meeting and have been recognized for my innovative thesis work.

Currently, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant at Oklahoma State University under the guidance of Dr. Paritosh P. Ramanan, where I am dedicated to advancing the field of industrial engineering through innovative research and collaboration.
